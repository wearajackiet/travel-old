Okay, just kidding, my pictures aren't that great, but I wanted somewhere better to share them and to also play around with CSS, Javascript, and HTML. And thus, Where's Jackie At 2.0 was born.</p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">After a fascinating 11 hour drive from Fremont, through all of the loveliness that Northern California (okay, Jefferson), and Oregon had to offer, we found ourselves in Portland, land of no sales tax and donuts. It was so cool driving into the city. The GPS told us we were a mere 10 miles from our destination, but it still looked like wilderness. And suddenly, we exploded into the city, high on I-5, and saw all of Portland basking in the sunset. It was amazing. I would definitely do this drive again even just for that experience again.</p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">Absence makes the heart grow fonder. We wound up in Seattle and were heckled by many homeless people. More so than I remember when I lived here last summer for three months. But no matter how large the homeless presense was or how difficult and expensive driving around Downtown Seattle wound up being, I loved it then, and I love it even now.</p>

We definitely wanted to get the full Canadian experience, so we ventured into poutine, maple syrup, and Tim Horton's. It was such fun to get to experience Vancouver, and all on the fly. Seriously. We did very little planning other than booking an AirBnB to stay in. We crossed the border and only then did we realize we didn't have any Canadian money. But it turned out well and we came back with Canadian maple syrup.</p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">I made my way from Portland to the Oregon Coast Highway, a slight bit out of my way to my AirBnB in Eugene. But driving along the coast is something that's always been appealing to me. And so I drove through the little towns of Oregon that were less populated than Davis. The exorbitant amount of vineyards and vendors selling fruits and the colorful houses that lined the road made these towns seem quite lively, even just in passing. But when I approached the coast, I noticed the clouds lingering thickly, meaning that on the longest day of the year, there's no chance that I could get a clear view of the sun setting from the western coast. But wandering around the trails in this weather reminded me so much of my San Francisco exploration date in March, except quite a bit spookier since this time, I was alone.</p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">I stayed the night in Eugene and in the morning, drove to Crater Lake. The drive was pretty cool. It was ridiculously cloudy in Eugene for whatever reaosn, but the sky started to clear up and I started doing some borderline dangerous things while driving... as evidenced by some of the photos. But hey! I'm alive. I tried to be as safe as I could. And nobody got hurt!<br><br>Crater Lake is the deepest lake in the U.S. and also the bluest. It was mesmerizing seeing it for the first time! Apparently, it's supposed to be a volcano (Wizard Island) within a volcano, both of which are currently dormant. They had a lot of different hikes and such, but I had to make it to Eureka before 10, so I only did a couple of the shortest ones. After a while though, the terrain and the trees and the lake all started to look the same, so I didn't feel like I was missing out on too much. The only downside was that it cost $15 to get in and I only spent a couple hours there.</p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">The Redwood Highway was beautiful! The steep slopes and redwoods growing almost parallel to the terrain made it more amazing than the Oregon Coast Highway. It was so ridiculously fun to drive through it all. It was so nice being the only car for miles going as quickly (and safely! Safety first!) I could. Since I was concentrating on the drive and such and since it got pretty dark, I didn't get many pictures of the redwoods, but I did get a newfound desire to acquire a sports car somehow and drive through it all again.</p>
