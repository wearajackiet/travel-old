Portland Sunset
Because who doesn't love sunsets?</p><p class="modal-desc">Since we're much farther north than we're used to, the sun sets a lot later in the summertime than it does at home. And after taking the time to watch so many sunsets back in Davis, I noticed that the sun set a lot closer 11 hours north.

I've got a lot to learn about night time shots and longer exposure.

Voodoo Donuts
One of Portland's most popular donut shops. It's open 24 hours, and has a very interesting vibe to it. The donuts were pretty good, but I wouldn't say they were the best I've had.</p><p class="modal-desc">We decided to visit at around 10:30pm that night, and since it is a cash only place, it was swamped with homeless people begging for money. It was sketch enough that we decided to call an Uber home. Thank goodness Portland decided to allow Uber in their cities, hahaha.

The Waffle Window
This was quite literally a window that served waffles. I would highly recommend this place. It was delicious!

Blue Star Donuts
Most definitely the best place for donuts in Portland. There is no ridiculous line and crazy homeless people, and they have buttermilk donuts. It's like a buttermilk biscuit, but in donut form. Oh my god it was so good! The only downside of Blue Star is that it isn't open 24 hours, but my goodness, does it make up for that in quality.

Powell's City of Books
The world's largest independent new and used book store. It was so cool just getting lost in the aisles and seeing all the books, fresh off the presses or off somebody else's bookshelf.

Stumptown Coffee Roasters
My favorite place for coffee right behind Espresso Vivace. I've got beans from them so I can make their coffee at home.
