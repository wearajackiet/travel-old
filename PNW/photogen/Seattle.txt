Pike Place Market
Sometimes I forget it's actually a farmer's market and not just a crowded place that throws fish, has fresh oysters, and sells delicious Greek yogurt.

The Seattle Public Library
This library was one of the coolest I've been in. Definitely wish I spent more time going to the library when I actually lived in Seattle. It's ten stories tall and has the most interesting series of elevators to get up to the tenth floor.

Wasabi
The other sushi place. Shiro's, the restaurant opened by the world famous Jiro's apprentice, is just down the street. But unless you start lining up at 4:30 or make a reservation, it's nearly impossible to get seating there. So for those who missed their Shiro's but still want a sushi fix, Wasabi is here.

Despite not being the best, you really can't discredit them. Their sushi is really good! The three of us really loved the Belltown roll.
